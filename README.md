# PUBG Player Survival Modeling using Semi-Parametric and Non-Parametric Method

PUBG is a first/third-person shooter battle royale style game that matches over 90 players on a large island where teams and players fight to the death until one remains. Players are airdropped from an airplane onto the island where they are to scavenge towns and buildings for weapons, ammo, armor and first-aid. Players will then decide to either fight or hide with the ultimate goal of being the last one standing. A bluezone (see below) will appear a few minutes into the game to corral players closer and closer together by dealing damage to anyone that stands within the bluezone and sparing whoever is within the safe zone.
